# E-commerce Back End Starter Code


WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
`npm run seed`
`npm run start`
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database


video:
GET categories 
GET products
GET tags

POST create 'example data'
PUT update 'example data' -> 'car data'
DELETE delete 'car data'
