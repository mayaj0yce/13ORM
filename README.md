# E-commerce Back End Starter Code
By using insomnia and the CRUD path ways I can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data within a database.

(watch the video here)[https://youtu.be/n4LS-VdTKE4]
This video will demonstrate the command to invoke the applicaiton
`npm run seed`
`npm run start`

And the paths being shown in Insomnia
GET products
GET tags
GET categories
POST products create
PUT products update
DELETE product(s)


## Chalenges
The biggest challenge I faced on this was the PUT route. I had to program both the POST and GET routes to understand exactly what the code wanted me to do. After a few attempts and minor spelling errors I was able to get all the routes working successfully. 

## Key Components
`Express.js`
`MySQL`
`Insomnia`
`npm run seed`
In order to ge the code working correctly be sure to seed your data prior to loading the app so there is data to actually see.



POST create 'example data'
PUT update 'example data' -> 'car data'
DELETE delete 'car data'
